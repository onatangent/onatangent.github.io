## The New Right and Conservatism (5/23/20)

How can one be both a conservative and a member of the modern American Right, or both a member of the modern American Right and a conservative? Compared to any movement these self-avowed conseratives most highly distrust, the movements they put their weight behind end up conserving nearly nothing. It seems to me that if one wants to look for effective conservatives one should look at today's anti-conservative Democrats, though it seems likely they are in a troubled state and even at risk of collapse in the coming decade. From this I draw that those advocating a sincere conservatism are dupes or in special cases martyrs, and that those advocating an ironic conservatism advocate no sincere conservatism.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics (5/16/20)

I read that "the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy," and that in thermodynamics an *isolated* system is one that is "enclosed by rigid immovable walls through which neither mass nor energy can pass."

Let's work under the principles of experimental verification and falsification. Suppose there existed an isolated system S. Then either we are in S or we are not in S. If we are not in S, then we cannot know about S, for to know about S it would need to emit matter or energy for us to observe, in which case it would not be isolated. If we are in S, then we could never judge that it is isolated, as we would need to have knowledge about the boundary conditions of totality which could only be ascertained from a position outside these boundaries. And who could stand outside these boundaries?

This argument is not intended as anything like a disproof of the second law of thermodynamics, but a problematization of its existential grip in the sense scientists and other Schwarzgeraet experts take existence.
