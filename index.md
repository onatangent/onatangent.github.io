## Two Rights Make a Wrong (5/30/20)

I can think of much better people for my parents to have reproduced with than each other, for the production of optimal people. The thing is I really do mean *optimal* by any popular moral schema of which you can think. Not that I don't have my virtues: to name two, I share with my maternal relatives a quick and airy mental dexterity and with my paternal relatives a basic good-natured simplicity. But then look at how these virtues poison one another! The instincts of a line of humble American farmers have no idea what to do with the skills of the panwestern intelligentsia, and the risk of malformity and monstrosity smiles from every periphery. Meanwhile an untrained "good eye" melts away much of what is subtle and discerning about the taste of this intelligensia because is cruel for reasons that this eye cannot see; at the same time, the eye itself becomes coarse and weary through its overstrain. This as a somewhat self-serving provisional explanation for why I am tense, eccentric, and prone to nervous spasms.

## The New Right and Conservatism (5/23/20)

How can one be both a conservative and a member of the modern American Right, or both a member of the modern American Right and a conservative? Compared to any movement these self-avowed conseratives most highly distrust, the movements they put their weight behind end up conserving nearly nothing. It seems to me that if one wants to look for effective conservatives one should look at today's anti-conservative Democrats, though it seems they are in a troubled state and even at risk of collapse in the coming decade. Back to the topic at hand: from this I draw that those advocating a sincere conservatism are opportunists, dupes, martyrs, or more likely some admixture; and that those advocating an ironic conservatism advocate no sincere conservatism. Then immediately one asks: who and what are our anti-"conservatives"?

## Second Law of Thermodynamics (5/16/20)

I read that "the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy," and that in thermodynamics an *isolated* system is one that is "enclosed by rigid immovable walls through which neither mass nor energy can pass."

Let's work under the principles of experimental verification and falsification. Suppose there existed an isolated system S. Then either we are in S or we are not in S. If we are not in S, then we cannot know about S, for to know about S it would need to emit matter or energy for us to observe, in which case it would not be isolated. If we are in S, then we could never judge that it is isolated, as we would need to have knowledge about the boundary conditions of totality which could only be ascertained from a position outside these boundaries. And who could stand outside these boundaries?

This argument is not intended as anything like a disproof of the second law of thermodynamics, but a problematization of its existential grip in the sense scientists and other Schwarzgeraet experts take existence.
