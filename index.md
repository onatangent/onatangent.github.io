## Second Law of Thermodynamics (5/16/20)

I read that "the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy," and that in thermodynamics an *isolated* system is one that is "enclosed by rigid immovable walls through which neither mass nor energy can pass."

Let's work under the principles of experimental verification and falsification. Suppose there existed an isolated system S. Then either we are in S or we are not in S. If we are not in S, then we cannot know about S, for to know about S it would need to emit matter or energy for us to observe, in which case it would not be isolated. If we are in S, then we could never judge that it is isolated, as we would need to have knowledge about the boundary conditions of totality which could only be ascertained from a position outside these boundaries. And who could stand outside these boundaries?

It strikes me that this is how I approached the of the problem of God's (non)existence from my adolescent agnosticism.
